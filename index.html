<section id="About">
<h1 id="hello-again">Hello again!</h1>
<p>I’m A. P. Dougherty, and I’m a tinkerer. I write code, and love
taking on new projects.</p>
<p>I grew up in the Pacific Northwest, and received my Bachelor’s in
Aeronautics and Astronautics from the University of Washington. I have
since made the transition to working in software development, using
primarily Java professionally.</p>
<p>These days, I’m based in Chicago, and I’d really like to stick
around. Outside of work, I do my own <a href="#Projects">personal
projects</a>, write and perform <a
href="https://iwasaradio.bandcamp.com">music</a>, and read more than my
fair share of books. Some fun facts:</p>
<ul>
<li>I spent a season as a match commentator for a semi-pro eSports team
(Counter-Strike: GO, for those in the know). So I’ve got presentation
skills!</li>
<li>I hope to be a teacher someday.</li>
<li>I built a Rocket in college! <a
